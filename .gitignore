# Examples beginning with a dot (in the current directory):
# .gitignore

# It is often useful to ignore temporary files, build artifacts and
# local configuration files that are not useful to other developers.
# For example:
# *.tmp
# *.log
# .env
# build/
# node_modules/
# .vscode/
# .idea/
# __pycache__/
# *.pyc
# .DS_Store
# Thumbs.db

# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# You can also ignore files by prefixing them with a ! character to negate the ignore.
